Do you ever wake up wondering whether Akali would be Jisoo or if she's more of a Jennie? Well, we sure do. As this constant doubt consumed us, we decided to take action with the tools at hand: the aim of this project is to compare LoL characters to K-Pop artists using machine learning.

# To do
- [X] Docstrings for old code
- [X] Scraper -> Function for scraping for a single search term at a time
- [ ] Add script for finetuning an IMAGENET ViT on an ImageFolder DataLoader
- [ ] Scrape for 100 images of each girl
- [ ] Finetune model
- [ ] Compare each lol character and add a results table to this readme
